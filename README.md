# CA-simulator

Members: Nick Marshall, Jacob Mazur, Mary McCann

Project Idea: We will be building a software emulator for cellular automata. The program will run in a terminal and provide a visual representation of the state of the automaton being emulated. A major part of the project will involve determining how to read in a text representation of a CA, store the automaton state in memory, and simulate the behavior from the provided state.

Things to do:
- Create format to represent the Cellular Automata: DONE
- Be able to read in the CAs from the above format and parse the input and load it into a Board: DONE
- Simulate the automata using the iterate() method: DONE
- Create many example Cellular Automata DONE
- Create a visual representation of that simulation: DONE
